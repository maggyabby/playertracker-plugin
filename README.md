## player tracker plugin

this plugin allows you to have your player follow another player that is moving around with your eyes (looking at them constantly without moving body)

to use, enable the module while another player is in range. it will automatically lock on to the player closest to your current eye vector (closest to your crosshair)

while the module is still enabled it will continuously follow the player it is locked on to

if one turns the module off, it will stop tracking the player and forget who it was tracking. this means that one can quickly toggle it to switch to tracking a different player. 

this is my first plugin, so the code may not be the greatest, feel free to pr :)
